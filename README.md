Checkers Rules:

Contents: 
Game Board, 12 red Checkers, 12 black Checkers

Object:
Be first to remove all of your opponent’s Checkers 
from the Game Board. 

Set Up: 
Each player place 12 red or 12 black Checkers on the first three rows of black 
squares on your end of the Game Board. 

Play:
Decide who goes first. Players alternate turns. 
On your turn, move your Checker diagonally forward to a vacant black square, then your 
turn is over. You may jump an opponent’s Checker if the black square diagonally beyond 
that Checker is vacant. If possible, you can double or triple jump on a turn. After you 
jump over one of your opponent’s Checkers, remove it from the Game Board and place it 
nearby. 
Reach the back row of your opponent’s side of the Game Board with one of your Checkers 
and it becomes a King. Your opponent must place a Checker of the same color on top. 
It’s an advantage to have Kings because these two-level Checkers can move diagonally 
forward and backward! 

Winning:
If you’re first to remove all of your 
opponent’s Checkers from the Game 
Board, you win! Now go play again!
